This program will calculate the number of donuts sold hourly and daily at each of Top Pot's five locations using data provided by Top Pot on the minimum and maximum customers per hour, and the average number of donuts sold per customer. It will then render the amount of donuts sold hourly and the daily totals in a table on the HTML page. The buttons don't yet work.
